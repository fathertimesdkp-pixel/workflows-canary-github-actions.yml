Perfect. Let‚Äôs build out a README for your `fathertimesdkp-pixel` repo that reflects its purpose, tone, and audience. Based on your previous messages, it seems like this project may involve crypto, NFTs, JWTs, and possibly secure key management or blockchain identity.

Here‚Äôs a tailored draft to get us started:

---

üß† FatherTimeSDKP Pixel

Quantum Identity ‚Ä¢ NFT Licensing ‚Ä¢ Secure Key Infrastructure

---

üìò Overview

`fathertimesdkp-pixel` is a cryptographic framework designed to explore the intersection of digital identity, NFT citation, and secure key management. Built on the principles of the FatherTimeSDKP protocol, this repo serves as a sandbox for experimenting with:

‚Ä¢ JWT token validation and quantum-safe encoding
‚Ä¢ NFT citation and licensing tied to blockchain identity
‚Ä¢ Recovery phrase documentation and secure wallet access
‚Ä¢ SHA-256 notarization and oracle verification


---

üîê Key Concepts

Feature	Description	
JWT Keys	Encoded identity tokens for secure access and verification	
NFT Citation	Smart contract references tied to 0x311540cD8761e15F0B01aaa6Fe0F7E8f583B4Bf7	
Recovery Keys	Mnemonic phrases for Coinbase and other wallets	
Quantum Identity	Experimental model for post-blockchain identity anchoring	


---

‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notice

This repository may contain revoked or placeholder keys for educational purposes. Do not use any listed credentials in production environments. Always store sensitive data in encrypted vaults or secure hardware wallets.

---

üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Usage

1. Clone the repo
2. Review `keys/` and `citations/` folders for structure
3. Use environment variables to inject secrets securely
4. Run `verify.sh` to test JWT and NFT citation integrity


---

üìú License & Attribution

This project is authored by Donald Paul Smith (‚ÄúFather Time‚Äù) and is part of the broader FatherTimeSDKP initiative. All content is provided under a custom license for educational and experimental use.
